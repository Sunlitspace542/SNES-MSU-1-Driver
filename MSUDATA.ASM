; this file will generate a .inc file with equates when assembled, like this:
;; MSU data file offsets -- automatically generated by MSUDATA.ASM
;msu1data_teststring	equ	0 ; overall address of the data
;msu1data_teststring_byte1	equ	0 ; address bytes 1-4
;msu1data_teststring_byte2	equ	0 
;msu1data_teststring_byte3	equ	0 
;msu1data_teststring_byte4	equ	0 
;msu1data_teststringlen	equ	11 ; length of the data
; plug in the first equate (msu1data_[NAME]) to the msustream macro to stream data.
